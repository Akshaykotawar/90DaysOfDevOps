In Linux, file permission is an essential concept that determines who can access, read, write, or execute files and directories.
These permissions help to ensure that only authorized users can access sensitive data and protect the system from unauthorized access. 
Understanding file permission in Linux is crucial for anyone who wants to work with the operating system.

Linux file permission is divided into three categories: owner, group, and others. The owner is the user who created the file,
the group is a set of users who have common access rights, and others are all other users who are not the owner or in the group.

Each file and directory in Linux has three types of permission: read (r), write (w), and execute (x). These permissions can
be granted or denied for each category (owner, group, and others). For example, a file with the permission set to "rw-r--r--" 
means that the owner has read and write permission, while the group and others have only read permission.

To view the permission of a file or directory in Linux, you can use the "ls -l" command. The output of this command shows the 
file or directory name, the owner of the file, the group associated with the file, the file size, the creation date, and the file permission.

Changing file permission in Linux is also straightforward. You can use the "chmod" command to modify the file or directory permission. 
The "chmod" command can be used in two ways: symbolic mode and numeric mode.

In the symbolic mode, you can use letters to represent the user category (u for owner, g for group, and o for others) and the type of
permission (r for read, w for write, and x for execute). For example, to give the owner of a file read and write permission, use the command "chmod u+rw filename."

In the numeric mode, you can use numbers to represent the file permission. Each digit represents the permission for a user category 
(owner, group, and others), and the value of the digit represents the sum of the permissions. For example, to give the owner read,
write, and execute permission, use the command "chmod 700 filename."

In conclusion, file permission in Linux is a crucial aspect of the operating system. It helps to ensure that only authorized users
can access sensitive data and protect the system from unauthorized access. Understanding file permission and how to modify it is
essential for anyone who wants to work with Linux.
