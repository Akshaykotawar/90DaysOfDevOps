ACL : ACLs allow us to apply a more specific set of permissions to a file or directory without (necessarily) changing the base ownership and permissions. 
They let us "tack on" access for other users or groups.
[root]# getfacl /test.txt

# file: test.txt
# owner: owner name
# group: group name
user::rwx : user permission
group::rwx :group permission
other::--- :other permission
